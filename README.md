# Harmony-Transformer-v2

An improved version of the [Harmony Transformer](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000030.pdf). We evaluated the new model in terms of automatic chord recognition for symbolic music. For more details, please refer to ["Attend to Chords: Improving Harmonic Analysis of Symbolic Music Using Transformer-Based Models" (TISMIR 2021)](https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.65/).

*`BPS_FH_preprocessing.py`: preprocessing of the BPS-FH dataset
*`chord_recognition_models.py`: implementations of the three models in comparison: Harmony Transformer (HT/HTv2), Bi-directional Transformer for Chord Recognition (BTC), and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)
